Files for the course: "Deep Learning: Theory &amp; Practice"\
Asg 1 Q3 is about implementing the training algorithms for perceptron and T-perceptron and comparing them for both the linearly separable and non-separable datasets\
Asg 2 Q1 is about implementing from scratch the MLP (feed-forward and backprop) for classification on MNIST data and experimenting with activation functions\
Asg 2 Q2 is about implementing MLP for multi-label classification on Restaurant Reviews dataset and experimenting with hyperparameters\
The scribe assignment utilises RNN and LSTM for sentiment analysis, while experimenting with hyperparameters\
There was a Image Segmentation challenge as part of the course, you can find the report and codes for my attempt here\
Here, you can also find the codes, slides and report for the project on CNN Based Medical Image Segmentation
